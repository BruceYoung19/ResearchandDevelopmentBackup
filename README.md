# Research and Development Backup:

This is only a back up for the my project.
As I am currently running the operating system Manjaro.


This is not all of my work:
I have taken some code from the following:
1. https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/30/opencv-object-tracking/
2. https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/06/tracking-multiple-objects-with-opencv/ 
3.
